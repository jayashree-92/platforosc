The Website may be used to access data and other information relating to funds or accounts with respect to which HedgeMark Advisors, LLC serves as the 
Fund Monitor or in a similar capacity (the """"HedgeMark Funds""""), funds managed by investment managers who have agreed to manage HedgeMark Funds upon 
their respective launches (the """"Related Funds"""") and third party funds in which a user of the Website has an investment (the """"User Funds"""" and, 
 with the HedgeMark Funds and the Related Funds, the """"Funds"""").The Website also supports various analytics and calculations that permit Website users to
 generate reports that combine data from HedgeMark Funds, Related Fund and User Funds.

Access to information about User Funds is limited to investors in such User Funds that have been authorized by such User Funds.The permissible use and dissemination 
of information about a User Fund is controlled by such User Fund or its affiliates and is typically subject to confidentiality and other restrictions set out in 
an agreement between such User Fund and the recipient of such information or otherwise imposed by such User Fund or its affiliates.HedgeMark does not have the authority 
to waive any such restrictions and no agreement with, or communication from, HedgeMark or its affiliates should be deemed to waive any such restrictions or otherwise 
control the permissible use of such information.

Information available through the Website includes past performance and other calculations that are based in part on prior performance and/or positions. Past performance 
is not indicative of future results and no assurances can be given that the prior positions or activities held or taken by any Fund is indicative of such Fund's future activities.
Performance information available through the website will include unaudited and estimated results.Linking monthly estimates may overstate or understate actual performance.

HedgeMark is not affiliated with the Related Funds and the User Funds and is not offering interests in any Related Fund or User Fund.HedgeMark serves or, subject 
to the receipt of sufficient investor interest, expects to serve as the Fund Monitor of a HedgeMark Fund that is or will be advised by the relevant Related Fund's 
investment manager following a similar investment strategy as the Related Fund.The performance of a Related Fund is provided to show how the investment strategy employed 
by the investment manager of an existing or contemplated HedgeMark Fund has performed historically.The performance results of the Related Funds will generally not be 
adjusted to reflect any differences between such Related Fund and the relevant HedgeMark Fund.The results provided with respect to any Related Fund were not realized 
by a HedgeMark Fund and should not be considered indicative or predictive of the results that will be experienced by investors in a HedgeMark Fund.While the Related 
Fund's investment manager may act as an investment manager to one or more HedgeMark Funds, the investment manager will have no responsibility for any other aspect of 
any HedgeMark Fund, including but not limited to its structuring, establishment, appointment of counterparties, marketing or sale.

A Fund's investment manager may manage other funds or accounts with similar strategies whose performance differs from the Fund reported.The actual performance of a proposed 
HedgeMark Fund may be materially different from that of any other funds or accounts traded in accordance with such HedgeMark Fund's trading strategy, including a Related Fund, 
for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) the net asset value of the HedgeMark Fund may be different than the net asset value of the other funds or accounts, 
(ii) economic and market factors may affect the HedgeMark Fund differently, (iii) the fees, expenses, commissions and accounting used by the HedgeMark Fund may differ substantially 
from the other funds or accounts (iv) permitted underlying securities and investment guidelines may vary, (v) leverage limits applied to a HedgeMark Fund may be different than 
the other funds or accounts, (vi) the valuation methodologies used by the HedgeMark Fund may be different than the other funds or accounts, (vii) the liquidity of the HedgeMark 
Fund may be different than the other funds or accounts and subscriptions and redemptions may occur at different times and in different amounts in the HedgeMark Fund and the other 
funds or accounts, and (viii) the trading strategy of the HedgeMark Fund and such other funds or accounts may change over time to take into account various factors.There is no 
certainty that a HedgeMark Fund's investment practices will be similar to the historical investment practices of the associated Related Fund and those differences may be material.
The use of the historical performance of a Related Fund is provided solely for informational purposes and should not serve as the basis for a final determination to invest in any 
HedgeMark Fund.Additionally, (i) an investment manager's historical performance presented on the Website may represent the composite performance of multiple funds and/or accounts 
managed pursuant to the same strategy; (ii) an investment manager's performance may represent a fund with a different fee structure than a proposed HedgeMark Fund or the aggregate 
performance for a fund with different classes of interests subject to different fee or other terms for all or parts of the periods presented; (iii) an investment manager's 
performance may include performance of related funds or accounts for periods that precede the formation of the fund or account whose performance is presented; and (iv) an investment 
manager's personnel or strategies may have changed during or following the periods presented.

The differences described in this document can result in significant, and sometimes material, performance differences between a Related Fund and the associated HedgeMark Fund, 
both on short-term and long-term basis.Investors should be aware of these differences when reviewing Related Fund performance and other metrics.
